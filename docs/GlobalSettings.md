# Global Settings

# Sharing Settings Across All Plugins

Each plugin can have their own [Plugin Settings](<PluginSettings.md>).&nbsp; The settings are determined by the contents of the Python file.&nbsp; The plugins setting structure is very flexible, however many plugins require the same settings.&nbsp; The Global Settings plugin is a very basic plugin with no events.&nbsp; It only stores settings values.&nbsp; The standard plugin only stores the **ProjectsFolder** location, and **DefaultMeetingLocation**.
