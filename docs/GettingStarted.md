# Populating Your Database

Project Notes is capable of connecting information from various systems.&nbsp; In order to benefit from these capabilities, you will need to consistently name your clients, people, and project numbers.&nbsp; The first step in populating your database is importing clients and people.

&nbsp;

There are three methods to import clients and people.

* **Importing From Outlook** - A Python plugin is included with Project Notes for[ Importing and Exporting Outlook Contacts](<ImportingandExportingOutlookCont.md>). (The plugin does not support Outlook Express.)
* **Importing From XML** - All database items can be imported from a [Project Notes XML](<ProjectNotesXML.md>) file.&nbsp; File import is accessible from the [File Menu](<FileMenu.md>).
* **Entering Manually** - Client information can be entered using the [Client List Page](<ClientListPage.md>), and contacts can be entered using the [People List Page](<PeopleListPage.md>).

# Project Notes Preferences

Once your clients and people are setup, you will need to tell Project Notes which contact is the Project Manager coordinating all projects, and what company he works for.&nbsp; This information can be setup in the [Project Notes Preferences](<Preferences.md>).

# Plugin Settings

Project notes helps you find and generate artifacts related to your project.&nbsp; In order to do this you need to configure the plugins.&nbsp; The [Global Settings](<GlobalSettings.md>) plugin sets up the project location and any other specific information related to your implementation of Project Notes.&nbsp; Custom plugins can overwrite the [Global Settings](<GlobalSettings.md>) Python plugin.&nbsp; For more information, plugin providers should add a help item to the help menu.

# Populating Your Project Data And Plugins

Once you have configured Project Notes you are ready to start populating project data.&nbsp; Your edition of Project Notes may include custom plugins specific to your organization.&nbsp; These plugins may import project information from other enterprise systems within your organization.
