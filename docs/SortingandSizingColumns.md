# Customizing List Columns

Project notes allows you to resize your columns and specify which column to sort by. You can sort in ascending or descending order for one specified column. Any sizing and sorting changes are stored your profile. (They are not stored in the database.) The settings remains consistent for the list and do not change when a different project or other parent data is selected.

**To set a column width:**
1. Hover the mouse pointer over the border line in the column header.
2. Click and drag the border line to adjust the width.
3. Release the mouse button to save the width.

**To set a sorting column:**
1. Click the column header to sort in descending order.
2. To sort in ascending order, click the same column header again.

**To reset sorting and width of all columns to factory default:**
1. Choose **Reset Columns**, from the Right-Click menu on any list.
