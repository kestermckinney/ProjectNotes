# Managing Your List Of People

Project Notes keeps a list of people that can be associated with projects.&nbsp; Use the Outlook Import and Export plugin to keep your list of people in sync with Outlook.&nbsp; The [Importing and Exporting Contacts](<ImportingandExportingOutlookCont.md>) topic describes how to use the plugin.&nbsp; Project Notes may have a customization that imports and exports names from other enterprise applications such as an accounting system or customer relationship manager.&nbsp; Plugins installed should have their own help manual.&nbsp; To avoid duplicate records Project Notes uses the name as a unique identifier when importing.&nbsp; It is important to name people in Outlook the same as they are in the other enterprise systems that are synchronized.
