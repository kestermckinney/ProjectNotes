# History Menu

## Viewing Previous Pages
When navigating between pages, a page's state is saved to the database. Even after closing Project Notes and reopening it, all current selections and current tab will remain the same for each project.

## Page History
The **History** Menu shows the 20 most recent pages since Project Notes was started. Restarting Project Notes will clear out the **History** Menu.
