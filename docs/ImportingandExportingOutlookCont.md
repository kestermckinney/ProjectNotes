# Importing and Exporting Outlook Contacts

Project Notes includes a Python plugin to import from your personal contacts found in Microsoft Outlook.&nbsp; The plugin imports and exports the following fields:

&nbsp;

* &nbsp;
  * **FullName**
  * **Email1Address**
  * **BusinessTelephoneNumber**
  * **MobileTelephoneNumber**
  * **CompanyName**
  * **JobTitle**

&nbsp;

The plugin uses the Outlook Automation to import and export information.&nbsp; Outlook does not need to be running.&nbsp; If it is not running, Project Notes will run it temporarily to exchange data.

&nbsp;

1. From the **Plugins** menu in **Project Notes**, select **Import Outlook Contacts**.

&nbsp;

**To export contacts to Outlook:**
