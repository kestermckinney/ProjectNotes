# Customizing Your View

The **View** menu provides away for you to manage page visibility and project items visibility.&nbsp; Presenting project information to clients often requires a different view than working in Project Notes on day to day activities.&nbsp; The **View** menu will help you organize information and communicate more concisely with your clients.&nbsp; By checking and un-checking the **View** menu item, you can change the displayed information.

## Hiding Internal Project Items

Items such as **Action/Tracker,** **Meeting Notes,** and **Earned Value** amounts can be marked as internal items.&nbsp; Hiding items marked as internal also hides the **Internal** checkbox, so clients do not have a visual indicator that some items are hidden.&nbsp; When internal items are hidden, they will not be displayed in database search results found in the [File Menu](<FileMenu.md>).

&nbsp;

**To hide internal items:**

1. From the **View** menu, uncheck **Internal Items**.&nbsp;

## Showing and Hiding the Status Bar

The status bar conveys important information about import and export activity.&nbsp; It also displays function descriptions when you hover over menu items.&nbsp; You can hide the status bar if you need the additional screen real estate.&nbsp; You can show and hide the status bar by choosing it from the **View** menu.

## Showing the Projects Page

The Project Page is the home page for the currently open database.&nbsp; By default it lists all currently open projects.&nbsp; To return to the Projects Pages, select **Projects** from the **View** menu.

&nbsp;

**To show closed projects:**

1. From the **View** menu, select **Closed Projects**.

## Showing the Clients Page

The Clients Page lists all clients in the currently open database.&nbsp; To navigate to the Clients Pages, select **Clients** from the **View** menu.

## Showing the People Page

The People Page lists all people in the currently open database.&nbsp; To navigate to the People Pages, select **People** from the **View** menu.

## Changing Font Sizing

When sharing a screen during a meeting, a larger font may help readability.&nbsp; The last font size is saved when Project Notes is closed, and restored on startup.

&nbsp;

**To increase the font size:**

1. From the **View** menu, select **Increase Font Size**.

&nbsp;

**Te decrease the font size:**

1. From the **View** menu, select **Decrease Font Size**.

## Reviewing Tracker and Action Items

In most cases only **Tracker/Action** items that aren't resolved will be displayed in the **Tracker** Tab.&nbsp; To view **Tracker/Action** items that have been resolved check **Resolved Item/Tracker Items** from the **View** menu.

## Filtering Data

Almost every table view in Project Notes can be filtered.&nbsp; The [Filter Tool](<FilterTool.md>) is very powerful.&nbsp; To show the [Filter Tool](<FilterTool.md>), select **Filter** from the **View** menu.

## Navigating Between Open Pages

Project Notes keeps track of the previous open page.&nbsp; Note: It does not keep track of previously open data on a page.&nbsp; Navigating between pages of the same type will only show the last data open.&nbsp; For example, if multiple meeting notes pages are in the history, they will both display the same record.

&nbsp;

**To navigate to the previous page in history:**

1. Select **\<** from the **View** menu.

&nbsp;

**To navigate to the next page in history:**

1. Select **\>** from the **View** menu.
