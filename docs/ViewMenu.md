# View Menu

## Customizing Your View

The **View** menu provides away for you to manage page visibility and project items visibility. Presenting project information to clients often requires a different view than working in Project Notes on day to day activities. The **View** menu will help you organize information and communicate more concisely with your clients. By checking and un-checking the **View** menu item, you can change the displayed information.

## Hiding Internal Project Items

Items such as **Action/Tracker,** **Meeting Notes,** and **Earned Value** amounts can be marked as internal items. Hiding items marked as internal also hides the **Internal** checkbox, so clients do not have a visual indicator that some items are hidden. When internal items are hidden, they will not be displayed in database search results found in the [File Menu](<FileMenu.md>).

**To hide internal items:**

1. From the **View** menu, uncheck **Internal Items**.

## Showing and Hiding the Status Bar

The status bar conveys important information about import and export activity. It also displays function descriptions when you hover over menu items. You can hide the status bar if you need the additional screen real estate. You can show and hide the status bar by choosing it from the **View** menu.

## Showing the Projects Page

The Project Page is the home page for the currently open database. By default it lists all currently open projects. To return to the Projects Pages, select **Projects** from the **View** menu.

**To show closed projects:**

1. From the **View** menu, select **Closed Projects**.

## Showing the Clients Page

The Clients Page lists all clients in the currently open database. To navigate to the Clients Pages, select **Clients** from the **View** menu.

## Showing the People Page

The People Page lists all people in the currently open database. To navigate to the People Pages, select **People** from the **View** menu.

## Changing Font Sizing

When sharing a screen during a meeting, a larger font may help readability. The last font size is saved when Project Notes is closed, and restored on startup.

**To increase the font size:**

1. From the **View** menu, select **Increase Font Size**.

**Te decrease the font size:**

1. From the **View** menu, select **Decrease Font Size**.

## Reviewing Tracker and Action Items

In most cases only **Tracker/Action** items that aren't resolved will be displayed in the **Tracker** Tab. To view **Tracker/Action** items that have been resolved check **Resolved Item/Tracker Items** from the **View** menu.

## Filtering Data

Almost every table view in Project Notes can be filtered. The [Filter Tool](<FilterTool.md>) is very powerful. To show the [Filter Tool](<FilterTool.md>), select **Filter** from the **View** menu.

## Navigating Between Open Pages

Project Notes keeps track of the previous open page. Note: It does not keep track of previously open data on a page. Navigating between pages of the same type will only show the last data open. For example, if multiple meeting notes pages are in the history, they will both display the same record.

**To navigate to the previous page in history:**

1. Select **&lt;** from the **View** menu.

**To navigate to the next page in history:**

1. Select **&gt;** from the **View** menu.
2.
