# Send Project Emails

# Sending Project Related Emails (Windows Only)

The **Send Project Email** plugin automatically populates the subject of your email with the **Project Number** and **Project Name**.&nbsp; This makes your communication consistent and allows your recipient to quickly know what project your are referencing.&nbsp; Because your emails all have the **Project Number** in them, they can be searched by project or quickly archived using the [Project Email Archive](<ProjectEmailArchive.md>) plugin.&nbsp; The email recipients are automatically populated based on the item you right-clicked to call the plugin.&nbsp; *Note: The Project Manager specified in [Preferences*](<Preferences.md>) *is never included in the recipient list.*
