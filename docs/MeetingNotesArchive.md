# Meeting Notes Archive

# Archiving Meeting Notes to a PDF File (Windows Only)

The **Archive Meeting Notes** plugin automatically generates a PDF file containing all of the meeting notes taken for the project to date. By default all meeting notes not marked as internal are included in the report. You can specify a different report be generated that includes the internal notes and action items. The report will have "Internal" at the end of the name, if it contains items marked as internal. Internal reports are never automatically emailed.

**Report File Names and Locations**

The plugin looks for a **File/Folder Location** with a description of ***"Project Folder"*** to determine where to save the generated reports. See [Project Information Page](<Project Page>) to learn about **File/Folder Location**. Reports are placed in the sub-folder **"Meeting Minutes"** found in the specified ***"Project Folder"***.

The **Archive Meeting Notes** report is generated by copying the **"Meeting Template.xls"** file found in **"Project Notes\\plugins\\templates"** to the "Project Folder\\Meeting Minutes". By using OLE Automation for Microsoft Excel ([OLE Automation Wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLE\_Automation>)), the plugin opens and edits the template file filling in values, copying rows, and saving it to a PDF. (See Python's [Pywin32](<https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32>) module documentation.) Because the plugin is automating the activity of an outside application unpredictable situations may occur. If the script fails, you may want to close all Excel documents open by automation. To clean up stray Excel processes choose the **Close Stranded Excel** plugin from the **Plugins** menu. You may then need to open Excel and clear out any warnings or errors.

**Email Options**

The plugin will not automatically add recipients. It will create an email subject with the **Project Number**, **Project Name**, and **Date**. By default the Excel contents are copied and pasted into the email. However, you can choose to email an Excel or PDF attached version instead.
