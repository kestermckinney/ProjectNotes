# Meeting Notes Archive

# Archiving Meeting Notes to a PDF File (Windows Only)

The **Archive Meeting Notes** plugin automatically generates a PDF file containing all of the meeting notes taken for the project to date.&nbsp; By default all meeting notes not marked as internal are included in the report.&nbsp; You can specify a different report be generated that includes the internal notes and action items.&nbsp; The report will have "Internal" at the end of the name, if it contains items marked as internal.&nbsp; Internal reports are never automatically emailed.

&nbsp;

**Report File Names and Locations**

The plugin looks for a **File/Folder Location** with a description of ***"Project Folder"*** to determine where to save the generated reports.&nbsp; See [Project Information Page](<ProjectPage.md>) to learn about **File/Folder Location**.&nbsp; Reports are placed in the sub-folder **"Meeting Minutes"** found in the specified ***"Project Folder"***.

&nbsp;

The **Archive Meeting Notes** report is generated by copying the **"Meeting Template.xls"** file found in **"Project Notes\\plugins\\templates"** to the "Project Folder\\Meeting Minutes".&nbsp; By using OLE Automation for Microsoft Excel ([OLE Automation Wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLE\_Automation>)), the plugin opens and edits the template file filling in values, copying rows, and saving it to a PDF.&nbsp; (See Python's [Pywin32](<https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32>) module documentation.)&nbsp; Because the plugin is automating the activity of an outside application unpredictable situations may occur.&nbsp; If the script fails, you may want to close all Excel documents open by automation.&nbsp; To clean up stray Excel processes choose the **Close Stranded Excel** plugin from the **Plugins** menu.&nbsp; You may then need to open Excel and clear out any warnings or errors.

&nbsp;

**Email Options**

The plugin will not automatically add recipients.&nbsp; It will create an email subject with the **Project Number**, **Project Name**, and **Date**.&nbsp; By default the Excel contents are copied and pasted into the email.&nbsp; However, you can choose to email an Excel or PDF attached version instead.

&nbsp;
