# Power Point Templates

# Quickly Creating a Project Power Point (Windows Only)

You can quickly fill out key project values in a Power Point Document related.&nbsp; The **Get PowerPoint Template** copies the selected PowerPoint template to the project meeting minutes folder and fills out basic project information.&nbsp; The new document is added to the list of project artifacts found in the **File/Folder Locations** list in the [Project Information Panel](<ProjectPage.md>).

&nbsp;

**PowerPoint File Names and Locations**

The plugin looks for a **File/Folder Location** with a description of ***"Project Folder"*** to determine where to save the generated document .&nbsp; See [Project Information Panel](<ProjectPage.md>) to learn about **File/Folder Location**.&nbsp; Files are placed in the sub-folder **"Meeting Minutes"** found in the specified ***"Project Folder"***.&nbsp; The file name generated has the word Template removed from the original name.

&nbsp;

The **Get PowerPoint Template** file is generated by copying the selected file found in **"Project Notes\\plugins\\templates"** to the **"Project Folder\\Meeting Minutes"**.&nbsp; By using OLE Automation for Microsoft PowerPoint ([OLE Automation Wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLE\_Automation>)), the plugin opens and edits the template file filling in values.&nbsp; Because the plugin is automating the activity of an outside application unpredictable situations may occur. You will need to save all edits and generate a PDF manually.
