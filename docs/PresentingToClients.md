# Presenting To Clients

# Presenting to Clients

You will often need to review project status and take notes while sharing your screen.&nbsp; You don't want the clients you are sharing your screen with to see information about other clients.&nbsp; Project Notes allows you to hide information intended for internal use.&nbsp; Projects can be filtered by clients or by a specific project.&nbsp; See the [Filter Tool](<FilterTool.md>) for more details.&nbsp; Notes and tracker items can be marked as internal to keep sensitive comments from showing to clients.

# Marking Sensitive Content

There two different items that can be marked as internal: Meeting Notes and Tracker Items.&nbsp; Meeting notes can be set internal in the [Project Notes Page](<NotesPage.md>).&nbsp; Tracker Items can be marked internal in the [Item Tracker Page](<ItemTrackerPanel.md>) and [Action Item Detail Page](<ActionItemDetailPage.md>).&nbsp; When **Show Internal Items** is not checked in the **View** menu, the Internal check box is not visible to avoid making the viewer aware some items may be hidden.&nbsp; Also, when **Show Internal Items** is not checked the [Earned Value Metrics](<EarnedValueTerms.md>) do not show in the [Project List Page](<ProjectListPage.md>) or the [Project Page](<ProjectPage.md>).

&nbsp;

**To hide or show all internal information:**

1. From the **View** menu, choose **Show Internal Items**.
