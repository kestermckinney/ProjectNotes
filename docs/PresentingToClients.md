# Presenting To Clients

You will often need to review project status and take notes while sharing your screen. You don't want the clients you are sharing your screen with to see information about other clients. Project Notes allows you to hide information intended for internal use. Projects can be filtered by clients or by a specific project. See the [Filter Tool](<Filter Tool.md>) for more details. Notes and tracker items can be marked as internal to keep sensitive comments from showing to clients.

## Marking Sensitive Content

There two different items that can be marked as internal: Meeting Notes and Tracker Items. Meeting notes can be set internal in the [Project Notes Page](<NotesPage.md>). Tracker Items can be marked internal in the [Item Tracker Page](<ItemTrackerPage.md>) and [Action Item Detail Page](<ActionItemDetailPage.md>). When **Show Internal Items** is not checked in the **View** menu, the Internal check box is not visible to avoid making the viewer aware some items may be hidden. Also, when **Show Internal Items** is not checked the [Earned Value Metrics](<EarnedValueTerms.md>) do not show in the [Project List Page](<ProjectListPage.md>) or the [Project Page](<ProjectPage.md>).

**To hide or show all internal information:**

1. From the **View** menu, choose **Show Internal Items**.
