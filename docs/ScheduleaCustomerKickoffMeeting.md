# Schedule a Customer Kickoff Meeting

# Scheduling a Customer Kickoff Meeting (Windows Only)

The **Schedule Customer Kickoff** plugin automatically populates the title of your meeting with the **Project Number**, **Project Name**, and "Customer Kickoff" description.&nbsp; This makes your communication consistent and allows your recipient to quickly know what project your are referencing.&nbsp; Because your emails all have the **Project Number** in them, they can be searched by project or quickly archived using the [Project Email Archive](<ProjectEmailArchive.md>) plugin.&nbsp; The meeting description is automatically populated with the standard Customer Kickoff Meeting Agenda.&nbsp; If you specified an **DefaultMeetingLocation** in the [Global Settings](<GlobalSettings.md>), the Location value will automatically be populated.&nbsp; The meeting attendees are automatically populated based on the item you right-clicked to call the plugin.&nbsp; For the customer lessons learned meetings all team members are included. &nbsp; *Note: The Project Manager specified in [Preferences*](<Preferences.md>) *is never included in the recipient list.*

&nbsp;
