# Earned Value Terms

| **Earned Value Project Management Terms** |  |
| --- | --- |
| **BCWP** | The approved budget for the work actually completed by the specified date; also referred to as the budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP).&nbsp; Also referred to as Earned Value Travel costs are not included in calculations. |
| **BCWS** | The approved budget for the work scheduled to be completed by a specified date; also referred to as the budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS) and Planned Value (PV). The total Planned Value of a task is equal to the task’s budget at completion (BAC) — the total amount budgeted for the task. Travel costs are not included in calculations. |
| **Budget At Completion** | The total Planned Value (PV or BCWS) at the end of the project. If a project has a Management Reserve (MR), it is typically not included in the Budget At Completion (BAC), and respectively, in the Performance Measurement Baseline. |
| **Estimate At Completion** | There is no single definition on how to calculate Estimate At Completion or (EAC).&nbsp; The project status report uses the following formula.&nbsp; The reason for using the formula below is that it takes into account both the current schedule performance and budget performance.&nbsp; In this way the estimate at completion provides the most likely estimate of what the project will cost.&nbsp; Travel costs are not included in calculations. ![Image](<lib/NewItem2.png>) |
| **Cost Variance** | The Cost Variance is the percentage difference between the Earned Value and Actual Cost.&nbsp; A negative number indicates the project is running under budget as of the status date.&nbsp; As the project nears completion the variance should be less.&nbsp; If Cost Variance is greater than 20% the status indicator is yellow.&nbsp; If Cost Variance is greater than 33% the status indicator is red. |
| **Schedule Variance** | The Schedule Variance is the percentage difference between the Earned Value and the Planned Value.&nbsp; A positive number indicates the project is running ahead of schedule as of the status date.&nbsp; As the project nears completion the variance should be less.&nbsp; If Schedule Variance is greater than -20% the status is green.&nbsp; If Schedule Variance is less than -20% the status indicator is yellow.&nbsp; If Schedule Variance is less than -33% the status indicator is red. |
| **Percent Work Complete** | The Percentage of Work Complete is the percent of Earned Value compared to Budget At Completion.&nbsp; If Percent of Work Complete is greater than the Percentage of Budget Consumed it is a good indication the project is running under budget. |
| **CPI** | The cost performance index (CPI) is the budgeted cost of work performed divided by the actual cost.&nbsp; Values greater than 1 indicate greater project profitability. |
