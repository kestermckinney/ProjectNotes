# Standard Plugins

Project Notes includes a number of standard Python plugins. These plugins can be copied and modified in order to suit the needs of your organization. It is recommended that you build your own installation that includes your custom plugins as well as additional instructions. To learn more about how to make your own plugins see [Adding Functionality](<AddingFunctionality.md>).
