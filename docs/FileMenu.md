# File Menu

## Database Functions
The File menu contains items needed for database file operations.

2. Select the location to store your database file.
3. Type the name of your database without a file extension.
4. Click **Save**.

The search honors all [Global Filters](<PresentingToClients>), so you can search while sharing your screen in a meeting with a customer.
