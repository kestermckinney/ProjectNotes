# Schedule a Customer Status Meeting

# Scheduling a Customer Status Meeting (Windows Only)

The **Schedule Customer Status** plugin automatically populates the title of your meeting with the **Project Number**, **Project Name**, and "Customer Status" description.&nbsp; This makes your communication consistent and allows your recipient to quickly know what project your are referencing.&nbsp; Because your emails all have the **Project Number** in them, they can be searched by project or quickly archived using the [Project Email Archive](<ProjectEmailArchive.md>) plugin.&nbsp; The meeting description is automatically populated with standard Customer Status Meeting Agenda.&nbsp; If you specified an **DefaultMeetingLocation** in the [Global Settings](<GlobalSettings.md>), the Location value will automatically be populated.&nbsp; The meeting attendees are automatically populated based on the item you right-clicked to call the plugin.&nbsp; For the customer status meeting all team members are included. &nbsp; *Note: The Project Manager specified in [Preferences*](<Preferences.md>) *is never included in the recipient list.*

&nbsp;

**To schedule a customer meeting:**

1. Right-click on the project in the **Project List Panel**.

1. Make **Outlook** the active application with Alt+Tab or click the **Outlook** icon in the task bar.
