# Scheduling a Customer Status Meeting (Windows Only)

The **Schedule Customer Status** plugin automatically populates the title of your meeting with the **Project Number**, **Project Name**, and "Customer Status" description. This makes your communication consistent and allows your recipient to quickly know what project your are referencing. Because your emails all have the **Project Number** in them, they can be searched by project or quickly archived using the [Project Email Archive](<Project Email Archive Plugin>) plugin. The meeting description is automatically populated with standard Customer Status Meeting Agenda. If you specified an **DefaultMeetingLocation** in the [Global Settings](<GlobalSettings>), the Location value will automatically be populated. The meeting attendees are automatically populated based on the item you right-clicked to call the plugin. For the customer status meeting all team members are included.  *Note: The Project Manager specified in [Preferences*](<Preferences>) *is never included in the recipient list.*

**To schedule a customer meeting:**
1. Right-click on the project in the **Project List Panel**.

3. Make **Outlook** the active application with Alt+Tab or click the **Outlook** icon in the task bar.
4. Edit your meeting time and contents in **Outlook**.
5. Click **Send** to send the email.
