# Filter Tool

## Filtering List Views

With the Filter Tool, you can setup static filters. Static filters are saved in the database and can remain active when you close and re-open Project Notes. The Filter Tool window is modal. To access the page below it, you must apply the filter and close the windows to continue.

The filter button on the [Toolbar](Toolbar.md) will be enabled for lists that support the filter view.

**To open the filter tool:**

1. Choose **Filter** from the **View** menu.
