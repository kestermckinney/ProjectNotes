# Notes Page

## Taking Notes

The Notes Page is where you can take notes relating to your projects and assign action items to team members. Project Notes is designed for easy integration with other applications. For compatibility, Project Notes stores notes as HTML in the database.

**To open meeting notes:**

1. Double-click on the meeting in the meeting list.

## Creating a New Meeting

When you create a new meeting, the current date is automatically populated and a default meeting title is assigned.

**To create new meeting notes:**

## Assigning Action Items

Meetings should result in **Action** items. Project Notes considers **Action** items and **Tracker Items** to be the same information. When you assign an **Action** item in a meeting, the type on the **Action/Tracker** **Item** is automatically set to **Action**. The **Identified By** information is also set to the Managing Project Manager specified in the [Project Notes Preferences](<../InterfaceOverview/Preferences.md>). The **Date Identified** is set to the current date, and the **Priority** is set to **High**. The **Action/Tracker Item** is automatically associated with the meeting and the project. You can change the type in the [Action Item Detail Page](<ActionItemDetailPage.md>) or the [Item Tracker Page](<ItemTrackerPage.md>). You can also add notes about activity related to an **Action/Tracker Item** in the [Action Item Detail Page](<ActionItemDetailPage.md>). To access the Item **Tracker Page**, double-click the row counter on the **Action Item**.

**To assign an action Item:**
