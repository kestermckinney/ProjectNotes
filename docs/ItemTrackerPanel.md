# Item Tracker Panel

## Using the Item Tracker Page

The **Item Tracker Page** provides a flexible way to look at **Tracker Items** and **Action Items** that are created during project meetings. Often an **Action Item** created during a meeting will turn into work that will be performed later in the project. In some cases the action becomes a project issue. In these cases, the **Action Item** should be changed to a **Tracker Item**. Items can be sorted by the column value. Using the **Filter Tool**, you can view specific items for a selected project or all projects. Some changes to a **Tracker Items** change their relationship to a meeting or even a project. For these types of changes, you open the **Tracker Item** in the **Action Item Detail Page**. You may want to track notes against a **Tracker Item**. The **Action Item Detail Page** can capture updates to the action item.

**Filtering Items**

The [Filter Tool](<FilterTool>) can be used to filter items shown on the Item Tracker Page. The filter is stored based on the page and not based on the selected project. If you use different filters for different projects, you will need to change then each time you use the Item Tracker page.

**Sorting By Columns**
Columns can be sorted by clicking the column header. The sort direction arrow appears at the top of the column title. No arrow means the column is not sorted. For more detail see [Sorting and Sizing Columns](<Sorting and Sizing Columns>).

**Adding New Items**
A new project item will default to a **Tracker Item** for the selected project. It will be set to **Identified By** the **Project Manger** specified in the [Preferences](<Preferences>) using the current date as the Identified date. All new items have their **Status** set to **New** with a priority of **High**. The **Identified By** and **Assigned To** people on an activity must be on the project team.
