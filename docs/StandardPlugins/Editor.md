## Editing Script Plugins

If you intend on customizing Project Notes by changing the current plugins or creating your own, you will want to use an editor that supports Python syntax highlighting and auto completion features. The Editor plugin allows you to specify the editor executable to be called from the Plugins menu.

**To setup an editor:**

1. From the **Plugins/Settings** menu, click **Plugin Settings**.
2. Click the **...** button and choose the location of the edtior executable.
3. Click **OK**.
