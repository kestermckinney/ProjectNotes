# Project Email Archive (Windows Only)

## Archiving Project Related Emails

The **Archive Project Email** plugin automatically exports Outlook emails related to a project into the specified **Project Folder**. The plugin looks for the Project Number in the email subject in order to determine if it is a related email. The email files are given a unique name that includes the date and time they were sent. The plugin will not overwrite existing files, so it can be ran as many times as needed to capture the most current email. Warning: The plugin can take a long time depending up the amount of email to be scanned and your network connection.

## File Names and Locations

The plugin looks for a **File/Folder Location** with a description of ***"Project Folder"*** to determine where to save the generated reports. See [Project Information Page](<../InterfaceOverview/ProjectPage.md>) to learn about **File/Folder Location**. Sent emails are placed in the sub-folder **"Correspondence\\Sent Email"** found in the specified ***"Project Folder"***. Received emails are placed in the sub-folder **"Correspondence\\Received Email"** found in the specified ***"Project Folder"***.

**To archive project related email:**

1. Right-click on the project in the **Project List Panel**.
2. Choose **Archive Project Email**.
3. Click **Yes** to continue.
