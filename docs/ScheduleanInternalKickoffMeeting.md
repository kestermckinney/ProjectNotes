# Scheduling an Internal Kickoff Meeting (Windows Only)

The **Schedule Internal Kickoff** plugin automatically populates the title of your meeting with the **Project Number**, **Project Name**, and "Internal Kickoff" description. This makes your communication consistent and allows your recipient to quickly know what project your are referencing. Because your emails all have the **Project Number** in them, they can be searched by project or quickly archived using the [Project Email Archive](<ProjectEmailArchive.md>) plugin. The meeting description is automatically populated with the standard Internal Kickoff Meeting Agenda. If you specified an **DefaultMeetingLocation** in the [Global Settings](<GlobalSettings.md>), the Location value will automatically be populated. The meeting attendees are automatically populated based on the item you right-clicked to call the plugin. For the internal kickoff meeting only team members with a client matching the **Managing Company** specified in [Preferences](<Preferences.md>) are included.  *Note: The Project Manager specified in [Preferences*](<Preferences.md>) *is never included in the recipient list.*

**To schedule an internal meeting:**

1. Right-click on the project in the **Project List Panel**.
2. Choose **Schedule Internal Kickoff**.
3. Make **Outlook** the active application with Alt+Tab or click the **Outlook** icon in the task bar.
4. Edit your meeting time and contents in **Outlook**.
5. Click **Send** to send the email.
