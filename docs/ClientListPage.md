# Client List Page

# Managing Your List Of Clients

Project Notes keeps a list of your clients.&nbsp; You should use the Outlook Import and Export plugin to keep your client names in sync with outlook.&nbsp; The [Importing and Exporting Contacts](<ImportingandExportingOutlookCont.md>) topic describes how to use the plugin.&nbsp; Your edition of Project Notes may have a customization that imports and exports client names from other enterprise applications such as an accounting system or customer relationship manager.&nbsp; To avoid duplicate records Project Notes uses the name as a unique identifier when importing.&nbsp; It is important to name your clients in Outlook the same as they are in the other enterprise system you synchronize client names with.
