# Client List Page

Project Notes keeps a list of your clients.You should use the Outlook Import and Export plugin to keep your client names in sync with outlook.  The [Importing and Exporting Contacts](ImportingandExportingOutlookCont.md) topic describes how to use the plugin.  Your edition of Project Notes may have a customization that imports and exports client names from other enterprise applications such as an accounting system or customer relationship manager.  To avoid duplicate records Project Notes uses the name as a unique identifier when importing.It is important to name your clients in Outlook the same as they are in the other enterprise system you synchronize client names with.
