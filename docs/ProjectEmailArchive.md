# Project Email Archive

# Archiving Project Related Emails (Windows Only)

The **Archive Project Email** plugin automatically exports Outlook emails related to a project into the specified **Project Folder**.&nbsp; The plugin looks for the Project Number in the email subject in order to determine if it is a related email.&nbsp; The email files are given a unique name that includes the date and time they were sent.&nbsp; The plugin will not overwrite existing files, so it can be ran as many times as needed to capture the most current email.&nbsp; Warning: The plugin can take a long time depending up the amount of email to be scanned and your network connection.

&nbsp;

**File Names and Locations**

The plugin looks for a **File/Folder Location** with a description of ***"Project Folder"*** to determine where to save the generated reports.&nbsp; See [Project Information Panel](<ProjectPage.md>) to learn about **File/Folder Location**.&nbsp; Sent emails are placed in the sub-folder **"Correspondence\\Sent Email"** found in the specified ***"Project Folder"***.&nbsp; Received emails are placed in the sub-folder **"Correspondence\\Received Email"** found in the specified ***"Project Folder"***.

&nbsp;

**To archive project related email:**

1. Right-click on the project in the **Project List Panel**.
1. Choose **Archive Project Email**.
