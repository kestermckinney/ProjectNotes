# Editing Details on Action/Tracker Items

The **Action Item Detail Page** provides the ability to add comments about work being done on an **Action/Tracker Item**.&nbsp; It also gives you the flexibility to move an item between projects or meetings.&nbsp; Keep in mind.&nbsp; If you change projects, related items such as the **Meeting**, **Identified By**, and **Assigned To** are cleared.&nbsp; The **Action Item Detail Page** has a text box for entering multiple lines of text when entering the **Description** of the **Action/Tracker Item**.&nbsp; Any changes in the **Action Item Detail Page** causes the [Item Tracker Pagel](<ItemTrackerPanel.md>) to refresh.&nbsp; When you change any information related to the **Action/Tracker Item** the **Last Updated** date will change to the current date.&nbsp; If you set the status to **Resolved**, the **Date Resolved** is set to the current date.

&nbsp;

**Comments**

Comments can be multiple lines.&nbsp; When you add a new comment it defaults the **Updated** date to the current date.&nbsp; **Updated By** defaults to the **Project Manger** specified in [Preferences](<Preferences.md>).&nbsp; **Comments** are intended to be a quick note.
