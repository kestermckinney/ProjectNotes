# Editing Details on Action/Tracker Items

The **Action Item Detail Page** provides the ability to add comments about work being done on an **Action/Tracker Item**. It also gives you the flexibility to move an item between projects or meetings. Keep in mind. If you change projects, related items such as the **Meeting**, **Identified By**, and **Assigned To** are cleared. The **Action Item Detail Page** has a text box for entering multiple lines of text when entering the **Description** of the **Action/Tracker Item**. Any changes in the **Action Item Detail Page** causes the [Item Tracker Page](ItemTrackerPage.md) to refresh. When you change any information related to the **Action/Tracker Item** the **Last Updated** date will change to the current date. If you set the status to **Resolved**, the **Date Resolved** is set to the current date.

## Comments

Comments can be multiple lines. When you add a new comment it defaults the **Updated** date to the current date. **Updated By** defaults to the **Project Manger** specified in [Preferences](Preferences.md). **Comments** are intended to be a quick note.
