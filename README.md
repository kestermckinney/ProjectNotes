## Related Projects

Many of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](<https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug>) and the [mono debug adapter](<https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug>) repositories are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](<https://github.com/kestermckinney/ProjectNotes/wiki/Related-Projects>) page on our [wiki](<https://github.com/kestermckinney/ProjectNotes/wiki>).

## Bundled Extensions

VS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](<extensions>) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix language-features. For example, the json extension provides coloring for JSON and the json-language-features extension provides rich language support for JSON.

## Development Container

This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

* For [Dev Containers](<https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers>), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
  * If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](<https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode>) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.
* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces>) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

Docker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run full build. See the [development container README](<.devcontainer/README.md>) for more information.
